# DENSE
Dark Energy: Numerically Simulated Evolution

--- Description ---

Script to numerically solve the scalar field equation for a quintessence field, and compare with a modified gravty model (Kinetic Gravity Braiding) and LCDM.

Currently set up for a novel oscillating scalar field 'Sharp Transition Scaling Quintessence'. This can be modified by changing the potential and its derivatve, and chosing appropriate initial conditions. The locations of each is clearly labelled in the script.

--- Requirements ---

Packages - Numpy, Scipy, Multiprocessing

Scripts - DENSE and plots in combination or DENSEwin and plotswin in combination

Other - Latex package (texlive reccommended) required for plots. 'useTeX=True' can be commented out for use without Latex
