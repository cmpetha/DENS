# DENSE
Dark Energy Numerical Simulation
Script to numerically slve the scalar field equation for a quintessence field.
Currently set up for a novel oscillating scalar field 'Sharp Transition Scaling Quintessence'
This can be modified by changing the potential and its derivatve, and chosing appropriate initial conditions. 
The locations of each is clearly labelled in the script.
